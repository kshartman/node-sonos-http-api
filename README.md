## New Modern TypeScript Implementation Available

I've created a complete TypeScript rewrite of this project with modern features and minimal dependencies:

### üöÄ [sonos-alexa-api](https://github.com/kshartman/sonos-alexa-api)

The new implementation offers:
- ‚úÖ Full TypeScript with type safety
- ‚úÖ Modern async/await patterns
- ‚úÖ Only 2 runtime dependencies
- ‚úÖ Native Node.js APIs (no frameworks)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced music search capabilities
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling and logging
- ‚úÖ Docker support with health checks
- ‚úÖ 96% test coverage
- ‚úÖ Full compatibility with existing Alexa skills

### Migration

The new API maintains compatibility with the original jishi/node-sonos-http-api, so existing Alexa skills and integrati\
ons should work without modification.

### Original Project

This fork was based on the excellent work by [@jishi](https://github.com/jishi) on the [original node-sonos-http-api](h\
ttps://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api).
